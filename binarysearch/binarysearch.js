/*
Firstly, you are to create three functions, as prototypes to the Array
class to return the following:
>`toTwenty()` returns `[1, 2, 3 . . . 20]`
>`toForty()` returns `[2, 4, 6 . . . 40]`
>`toOneThousand()` returns `[10, 20, 30 . . . 1000]`
Once you are done, create another prototype(d) function called `.search`,
it will take just one argument which is the number you are to find.
The search function should return an object, which contains
>`.count`, the number of times your function iterated to find the
index of the number in question
>`.index`, the index of the number in question
>`.length`, the length of the original array
The `.search` function should implement the _binary search algorithm_.
Each time you iterate, you should increase the count, to test how
efficient your implementation is
